# Changelog

## 1.1.0 (2026‑05‑05)

### Added
- **Full‑text search** (`search` command) using SQLite FTS5 with LIKE fallback and fuzzy scoring.
- **Fuzzy search boosts** for time‑of‑day (morning/afternoon/night), relative dates (yesterday, last week, weekdays, months), and categories.
- **Nap logging** (`nap` command) to track short sleep periods – start time, duration, and optional description.
- **Keyword editor** (`tools/keyword_editor.py` + `keyword_editor.html`) for pruning keywords and adding stopwords.
- **Event editor save fix** – deletes now persist immediately.
- **Stemming** (`porter2stemmer`) for keyword learning and search queries – handles plurals, possessives, and contractions.
- **Morphological tokenizer** – properly splits hyphenated words, removes possessives, and stems tokens.

### Changed
- **Keyword system overhaul** – replaced raw frequency with TF‑IDF + exact‑path boost (up to 10 suggestions).
- **Search** uses `OR` logic for forgiving multi‑word queries.
- **Calendar event display** switched to English titles (`title_en`), with Persian preserved as `title_fa`.
- **`nap` export** shows start‑end times (like sleep).
- **Naps** now appear in daily header and `today` summary.

### Fixed
- `ege` no longer clears the great event when logging is cancelled.
- `cge` command now accepts an optional argument (dispatch compatibility).
- Entry viewer shows Jalali dates in `YYYY‑MM‑DD` format.
- `last X mins` time parsing now works correctly.
- Various import and pagination fixes in `search` and `view`.

### Dependencies
- Added `porter2stemmer` to `pyproject.toml`.
